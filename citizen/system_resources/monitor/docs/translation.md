## Translation Support
Starting from `v1.8.0` you can choose the language of your Chat/Discord messages (eg restart warnings).  
This option can be found at `Settings > Global > Language`.  
  
If your language is not available, or you want to customize the messages, create a `locale/custom.json` file in your `txData` folder based on any language file found on [our repository](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin/tree/master/locale). Then go to the settings and select the "Custom" language option.  
  

> **Note:** If your language is not available in the list, feel free to do a [Pull Request](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin/pulls).
