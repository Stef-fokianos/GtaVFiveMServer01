# ziv-loadscreen
Full Screen YouTube loading screen for FiveM by ThatZiv (known as Zua now)

Heavily modified version of the keks loadscreen 

# Installation
Put the folder in your resources folder and then in your server config, put start ziv-loadscreen.

# Configuration
To change the loadscreen video, find the iframe tag in the index.html and change the video id (after the /embed/) to match the video id of your new video before the ?vqc

by default, the video plays in 720p. To change it, in the iframe tag in index.html, change the 720 after the hd in the link to 1080 or above

Change the headings to your community's discord and name (or delete if you don't want it there)
